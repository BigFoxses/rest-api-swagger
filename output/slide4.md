* `controllers`: ExpressJS is a Model-View-Controller web framework.  The Controller is basically the business logic for the app, where the View is what you ultimately consume as a web page, and Model defines the objects that would be referenced in your View and Controller.  In short, the Controller is somewhat like the glue between the Model and View.

* `swagger`: This directory holds the `swagger.yaml` file, which provides the definition for your REST API.  We will manipulate this file quite a bit using the Swagger Editor.
